# Machine Learning-Driven Algo Quantitative Trading Strategy with Systematic Market Prediction Framework

## Overview
This project showcases a robust quantitative trading framework using machine learning classification models and technical indicators to predict US stock index movements. Combining historical market and macroeconomic data, this framework aims to develop and backtest trading strategies that dynamically respond to evolving market conditions.

## Objectives
- **Data Acquisition**: Retrieve and process market data for the NASDAQ-100 (US100) along with key macroeconomic indicators, such as US Treasury Yield, Dollar Index, WTI Crude Oil, Gold, and VIX.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implement technical indicators like RSI, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, On-Balance Volume (OBV), and Momentum to capture underlying market trends and momentum.
- **Modeling and Tuning**: Apply and optimize machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a Stacking Classifier, to predict market directions.
- **Backtesting Strategy**: Evaluate the profitability of model-generated trading signals using historical data for realistic assessment and validation.

## Project Components

### 1. Market Data Collection
The `load_data` function leverages `yfinance` to pull historical daily market data for NASDAQ-100, and `load_macroeconomic_data` integrates relevant macroeconomic indicators, broadening the data landscape for analysis.

### 2. Technical Indicator Calculation
The `add_technical_indicators` function computes indicators like RSI, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages, and OBV, enhancing the dataâ€™s interpretability and its predictive value in machine learning models.

### 3. Data Preparation
Using the `prepare_data` function, the data is organized into model-ready features and target variables, including lagged features and normalized metrics for efficient training and evaluation.

### 4. Model Selection & Tuning
The `hyperparameter_tuning` function fine-tunes hyperparameters for models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The Stacking Classifier, defined in `define_stacking_model`, serves as an ensemble to aggregate model strengths for robust predictions.

### 5. Backtesting Strategy
The `backtest_trades` function incorporates a profit-target and stop-loss strategy to simulate real-world trading conditions, assessing profitability based on model predictions over historical data.

### 6. Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics
The `train_evaluate_and_backtest` function calculates performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, for each model. Additionally, backtesting results provide insights into trade outcomes (successful, loss, or no action), aligning model performance with market relevance.

### Sample Model Output
Detailed outputs from each model provide insight into model behavior and backtesting results:

- **Random Forest**: 
    - **Accuracy**: 0.48
    - **Precision**: 0.59
    - **Recall**: 0.27
    - **F1**: 0.37
    - **Backtesting**: 5 successful trades, 4 loss trades

- **XGBoost**: 
    - **Accuracy**: 0.54
    - **Precision**: 0.57
    - **Recall**: 0.76
    - **F1**: 0.65
    - **Backtesting**: 19 successful trades, 11 loss trades

- **LightGBM**: 
    - **Accuracy**: 0.53
    - **Precision**: 0.58
    - **Recall**: 0.59
    - **F1**: 0.58
    - **Backtesting**: 18 successful trades, 12 loss trades

- **Stacking Classifier**: 
    - **Accuracy**: 0.56
    - **Precision**: 0.56
    - **Recall**: 1.00
    - **F1**: 0.72
    - **Backtesting**: 25 successful trades, 16 loss trades

This output demonstrates the effectiveness of each model under historical data conditions, aiding in selecting optimal models for real-world application.

## Conclusion
This quantitative trading framework highlights the synergy between machine learning and financial markets, where feature engineering, model tuning, and backtesting coalesce to form a foundational strategy for systematic trading.
